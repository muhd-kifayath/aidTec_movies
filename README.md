# Movie Recommendation System
A movie recommendation system is a machine learning project that aims to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The primary goal is to enhance user experience by helping them discover movies they are likely to enjoy.
## Steps:
1. Data Collection and Loading:
•	Start by sourcing movie-related data from reliable and verified sources, such as IMDb or TMDb. This data should include details like movie titles, genres, release years, and user ratings. Once obtained, load the dataset into your project environment for further analysis.
2. Data Exploration:
•	After loading the dataset, it's crucial to explore its characteristics. Begin by checking the dimensions of the dataset, which provides an initial understanding of its size and structure. This step is fundamental for data preparation.
3. Data Analysis:
•	Calculate the mean ratings for each movie in the dataset. This computation allows you to assess the overall popularity of movies based on the collective user ratings they have received. Higher mean ratings typically indicate more popular movies.
4. Data Visualization:
•	Create data visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, or bar charts, to graphically represent the distribution of movie ratings. Visualization helps in identifying trends, outliers, and patterns within the rating data, offering valuable insights.
5. Data Preprocessing:
•	Develop a function to preprocess the dataset. This includes transforming the data into a matrix-like format suitable for collaborative filtering algorithms. Additionally, map unique movie IDs to ensure efficient analysis and recommendations.
6. Recommender System Model Selection:
•	Implement a function that selects and applies a recommendation algorithm, such as K-nearest neighbors with means (KNN with means). KNN-based models identify movies with similar user rating patterns, a core concept in collaborative filtering.
7. Model Training and Testing:
•	Transform the dataset into a format compatible with the chosen recommendation algorithm, particularly for libraries like Surprise, often used in recommendation systems. This step prepares the data for model training and testing.
8. Model Hyperparameter Tuning:
•	Optimize the model's performance by tuning its hyperparameters. Utilize techniques like GridSearchCV to systematically explore parameter combinations. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
9. Model Deployment:
•	Implement the best-tuned parameters in the KNN model to train it effectively. This trained model can predict user ratings and provide a list of 10 movies with high predicted ratings, tailored to a specific user.
10. User-Based Recommendation: 
•	Execute the user rating-based recommendation function. This function predicts and generates a list of 10 movies that a user is likely to rate highly, drawing from their historical preferences and interactions.
11. Movie-Based Recommendation:
•	Similarly, apply the movie-based recommendation function to identify and return a list of 10 movies that are similar to a given movie ID. This assists users in discovering related movies based on their preferences.
